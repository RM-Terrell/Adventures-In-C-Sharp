# Adventures in C Sharp!!

## What is it?
This repository started as a holding place for my solutions from The Euler Project, solved in C#. Solving these problems however quickly made me realize how poorly I understood many of the basics of C#. Thus the new I expanded the repository to not just contain solutions from Euler Project but across the web, from extreme basics to more advanced topics, all contained as small single file applications. All code was built using Visual Studio 2015.

## Project Section Guide
* Euler-Project-CS: contains solutions listed by their number of the Euler Project website solved in C# as console applications.
* MiscProblems: Sorted by folders, starting with classic 'Hello World!' type problems

## Running Solutions
* When opening in Visual Studio you may initially not see any of the .cs files appearing in solution explorer. You will need to toggle on "see all files" then manually right click -> "include in project" the one you want to compile. As I work I exclude old problem files from the project and compile them one at a time.
